# 🕹️ cub3D - My First RayCaster with miniLibX

**cub3D** is a project inspired by the legendary *Wolfenstein 3D* – considered the first true First Person Shooter (FPS) in video game history. This project is a deep dive into the world of **raycasting**, built using **C** and **miniLibX**. 🎮

## 📌 Project Overview

**cub3D** challenges to recreate a dynamic 3D view from a first-person perspective inside a maze. Using raycasting techniques, you'll render walls, textures, colors, and player motion in real-time. The project is a mix of math, graphics, and game logic — a great way to explore 3D engine fundamentals.

## 🧠 Core Objectives

- Understand and implement **raycasting** to simulate 3D perspective.
- Use **miniLibX** for rendering, textures, colors, and user interaction.
- Handle input from keyboard (WASD + arrows) and gracefully manage window events.
- Parse and validate a `.cub` configuration file containing texture paths, map layout, and RGB values for floor/ceiling.
- Ensure **player movement**, wall collision, and visual feedback are smooth and bug-free.

## ✨ Included Features

✅ Realistic 3D maze view using raycasting  
✅ Floor and ceiling colors  
✅ Directional wall textures (North, South, East, West)  
✅ Player movement: forward, backward, strafe, rotate  
✅ Graceful exits via ESC key and red window cross  
✅ `.cub` file parser with error handling  

## 🌍 Historical Context

This project is inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D* (1992), developed by id Software and designed by legends like **John Carmack** and **John Romero**. It paved the way for other iconic games such as *DOOM*, *Duke Nukem*, and *Quake*.

While the original game setting involved historical themes, this project is purely technical and creative, giving you the chance to build your own engine from scratch — without limits on imagination! 🚀
